        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Audrey Hepburn, the star of Roman Holiday, remains as one of Hollywood's greatest style icons and one of the world's most successful actresses.</p>
          <p>May 4th 1929, the actress, philantropist, and fashion icon was born Edda Kathleen Hepburn-Ruston in Brussels, Belgium to an honorary British consul Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston and Dutch noblewoman Baroness Ella van Heemstra.</p>
          <p>Hepburn had her first starring role in Roman Holiday alongside actor Gregory Peck, which gained her critical acclaim for her portrayal as Princess Ann, an European princess, unexpectedly winning her the Academy Award for Best Actress, BAFTA
            Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, and Golen globe Award for Best Actress.</p>
          <p>In her later years, Hepburn chose to devote more time for her family and only acted occasionally. She finished her last motion-picture role - cameo appearance as an angel in Steven Spielberg's <em>Always</em>, and completed only two more entertainment-related
            projects after that. On the evening of 20 January 2003, Hepburn died in her sleep at her home in Tolochenaz, Vaud.</p>
